# SQL-Queries-Project-Pizza-Sales
This project showcases my SQL skills through a comprehensive, real-world data analysis scenario using a detailed pizza sales dataset. Built entirely using MySQL, the project highlights my ability to work with relational databases and perform end-to-end data analysis using structured query language.

The primary objective was to demonstrate proficiency in writing efficient SQL queries and applying data analytics techniques to uncover meaningful insights from raw transactional data. The analysis involves cleaning and preparing the dataset, ensuring data accuracy and consistency, and crafting optimized queries to handle various questions.

Using aggregate functions, joins, grouping, and subqueries, I explored trends such as total revenue, peak order times, best-selling pizzas, average order value, and customer behavior patterns. The project simulates real-world analytical tasks that data analysts commonly face in industries like retail, food services, and e-commerce.

Each SQL query in this project is designed to answer a specific business question, reflecting a practical approach to data-driven decision-making. By presenting well-structured, logical, and insightful results, the project demonstrates both technical skill and analytical thinking.

This project serves as a key addition to enhance my overall portfolio, emphasizing my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using MySQL. It reflects a strong foundation in SQL and a commitment to applying those skills to solve real problems.
